# odin-recipes
Project 1 of The Odin Project (Foundations)

In this project, I created a (very!) simple recipe site with three
Viking-themed recipes. I learned/practiced how to:

1) Use Git and GitHub
2) Use HTML to add pictures, headings, paragraphs, links and lists
3) Complete a project from A to Z in Linux, using Git & GitHub and VS Code.
