    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Mead was the favourite alcoholic drink of the old Norse societies in the Viking Age. It's based on honey and is a very sweet drink that's becoming increasingly popular once again.</p>
      <p>Here's how to make your very own home-brewed mead for a Viking-themed event!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Honey - 6.5 kg</li>
        <li>Lalvin D-47 yeast - 2 packages (about 0.5 g per liter)</li>
        <li>Fermaid K yeast nutrient - 9 grams (3 g per occasion)</li>
        <li>DAP yeast nutrient - 6 grams (2 g per occasion)</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix the honey with some warm water. Then mix in water more water for a total volume of about 15 liters. (or as much as you wish to achieve a certain OG).</li>
        <li>Add the dry yeast. If you want to give the yeast an extra boost, it can be rehydrated with the addition of 1 gram of Go-Ferm per gram of dry yeast.</li>
        <li>Ferment at about 17 - 18 Â°C.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Fermentation</h4>
        <p><strong> Day 1 (one day into the fermentation)</strong></p>
        <p>Gently stir with a sanitized spoon or wine whip to degass the mead. Add 2,5 grams of Fermaid K and 1 grams of DAP.</p>
        <p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>
        <p>Gently stir with a sanitized spoon or wine whip to degass the mead.</p>
        <p><strong>Day 3</strong></p>
        <p>Gently stir with a sanitized spoon or wine whip to degass the mead. Add 2,5 grams of Fermaid K and 1 grams of DAP.</p>
        <p><strong>Day 4</strong></p>
        <p>Gently stir with a sanitized spoon or wine whip to degass the mead.</p>
        <p><strong>Day 6</strong></p>
        <p>Gently stir with a sanitized spoon or wine whip to degass the mead. Add 2,5 grams of Fermaid K and 1 grams of DAP.</p>
        <p><strong>After 3-4 weeks</strong></p>
        <p>Rack the mead into a secondary fermentation vessel, such as a PET carboy. The fermenter should be as small as possible to reduce the size of the air pocket. Put the fermenter in a cold, dark place so that it clears faster.</p>
        <p>Bottle when the mead has cleared, or when it seems ready. Still mead is the most common. For this we recommend wine bottles and corks.</p>
        <p>If you prefer a carbonated mead, you need to add priming sugar before bottling. For this we recommend champagne or beer bottles.</p>
